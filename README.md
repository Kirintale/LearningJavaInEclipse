# LearningJavaInEclipse
The purpose of this project is to give people new to programming and eclipse a hands on experience in learning programming. The system involves looking through and interacting with pre-written code in Java, in the eclipse environment . As the course progresses simple and "fun" assignments will be provided based on the information that has been learnt, along with details about design principals. As a note, these projects should not be taken in isolation and outside reading will be required to get a full understanding of the language.

As no system was developed in isolation, neither should this. If you find any errors, mistakes, have any questions/recommendations for improvements or if you feel like any stage requires more explanation. Please include them in the comments section.

# Ok first things first why Java?
Java is an Object Orientated (OO) programing language that works across multiple platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows etc…). It’s used by a wide range of people, is well supported and you do not have to worry about memory management, making it relatively easy to learn. There are also decent Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) (Read - The place where you write your code), which makes your life easier.

# What do you need?	
Eclipse (the IDE) - https://www.eclipse.org/
Java JDK (Java Development Kit) -  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Nice extras. 
Personally I use Beyond Compare but you have to pay for that. The following appears to be a nice alternative (http://meldmerge.org/) . What it enables you to do is to compare folders, see what changes have been made (by looking in each document) and help you pick if any you want to change over to the other folder you are comparing to. E.g. Two folders both with a file called “Word.txt” in it. One is has old fully functioning code the the other contains my new broken code. Its easy to see what changes I have made. I can then then choose to slowly migrate my broken code to the functioning one to see what broke it or when someone else reviews my code, they can see what changes I have made and only review the work I have done.

# Getting Started 
Create a folder on your hard disk where you want to work.
I.e - C:\Work\Coding
Create a folder for your project
C:\Work\Coding\MyFirstProject
Create a folder for your workspace (don’t really worry about what this actually is)
C:\Work\Coding\Workspace

Open eclipse and set the workspace to the folder you just created.

Will guide you through the traditional “Hello World” application. If you can run through this and it works then you will know you have set up your computer correctly. It also provides you with an nice starting environment for future projects.
