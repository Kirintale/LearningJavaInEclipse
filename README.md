# LearningJavaInEclipse
The purpose of this project is to give people new to programming and eclipse a hands on experience in learning programming. The system involves looking through and interacting with pre-written code in Java, in the eclipse environment . As the course progresses simple and "fun" assignments will be provided based on the information that has been learnt, along with details about design principals. As a note, these projects should not be taken in isolation and outside reading will be required to get a full understanding of the language.
